SnowPilot (https://snowpilot.org/) is a free, open-source software designed to help users graph, record, and store snowpit data. The SnowPilot database currently contains data from over 65,000 snowpits, collected by avalanche professionals and snow scientists around the world. It is particularly popular among avalanche professionals in the United States.

Despite SnowPilotâ€™s widespread use to graph and record snowpit data, the SnowPilot database has been underutilized as a research resource. This is due in part to the complexity of the data and lack of available tools for accessing specific snowpit properties.

To address these challenges and improve accessibility to the database, we are developing an open source Python library that enables researchers to import and structure data from the SnowPilot database within Python, facilitating the use of Python tools and methods for analysis.

Additionally, we are creating open-access Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the utility of this library to investigate snow science questions. A preliminary application of these tools includes a graphical representation of the relationship between hand hardness and primary grain form of snow pit layers from snowpits in Montana. The associated Jupyter notebook outlines the process and methodological approach taken when utilizing these tools to explore the research question.
