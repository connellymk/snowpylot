Guidelines for Proceedings Publications
1. Length - The length of each oral paper submitted for publication shall not exceed a total of
twelve, single-spaced, typewritten pages in the format described below or the equivalent in
charts, tables, pictures, and list of references. The length of each poster paper shall not
exceed four pages. Poster dimensions are 36" tall and 48" wide, which match the standard
proportions of a PowerPoint slide. Exceptions may be granted by Editor, upon request.

2. Format - All submissions must include both a digital copy and a printed copy. The first page
is to include a title in bold capital letters centered at the top of the page followed immediately
by a blank line and then by the author’s name(s), which is not bold but is centered. The
author's affiliation is to be shown by at the bottom of the first page. All papers should be
printed on 8-1/2 by 11-inch paper with the margin being: 0.8 inch at top, 1.0 inch at the left
and right side, and 1.2 inches at the bottom.

3. Type - Required font size is 10, and the font is Times New Roman. It is the author’s
preference as to whether the text is left-justified only, or right- and left-justified. The Editor
prefers left-justified only.
4. Text - The text shall be single spaced with a single blank line between paragraphs and before
and after first-order headings. The title is all caps, bold, centered, single spaced, and NOT
underlined. First-order headings are to be bold, centered, and typed in capital letters and
underscored on a line alone. Second-order headings are to be bold, left-justified, and typed
with an initial capital for each word and the rest of the letters in lower-case, and underscored
on a line alone. No blank line will be left after second-order headings. Third-order headings
are as second-order headings except that they are italicized and are without underscoring.
The first line of each new paragraph shall be indented one-half inch with a hard or soft tab.

5. Illustrations - All charts and figures are to be readable, including axis labels and dimensions.
If illustrations contain color (plots with colored lines, shading, dots, etc), be aware that the
Proceedings is published in black and white. Color features will be viewable in PDFs posted
to the WSC website, so color versions should be submitted. Use dashes, dots, or other means
to distinguish between lines and symbols. All figures are to be located as near to the place of
their first mention in the text as is practicable. The figure caption should be below the figure
and separate from the figure and be full size (font size of 10). Please do NOT include the
caption in the JPG or PNG of the figure since the figure is often scaled to fit and the caption
becomes too larger or too small. The label should left-justified, and all lines of the caption
should be evenly indented. Figures will be numbered sequentially, and only the initial word
in the caption will be capitalized. The word “Figure” is spelled out completely both in the
text and in the caption, and the number is followed by a period. Please try printing your
paper/figures in black and white to see if the meaning is lost without the color.

6. Tables - Data presented in the text should appear as close to their first mention in the text as
is practicable. Any reduction of tables necessary to fit between the margins must be
accomplished prior to submission of the paper and remain readable. Table titles are above
the table and should be included with the paper text and not be part of the table graphic. All
lines of the table caption should be evenly indented from the “Table X.” label, and the label
should be left justified. All tables are to be numbered sequentially, and only the initial word
in the captions will be capitalized.

7. Photographs - All digital photographs should be JPEG, PNG, or TIFF format to allow for
scaling, and the figure caption should be left-justified with all lines of the caption indented
evenly. Color photos will be reproduced in black and white in the Proceedings, but PDF
proceedings posted on the WSC website will benefit from color photos.

8. Page numbers - Do not type in or format with a page number. Pages will be assigned during
printing.

9. References - All references in the text should include the author's name and date of
publication. The list of references at the end of the paper should be placed in alphabetical
order according to the author's last name. Double space between references, and left justify
all lines. Use references available to the general public whenever possible. Abbreviations of
references should be avoided.

10. Units - The SI system of units must be used for dimensional quantities. English units may
be placed in parentheses. The presentation may be made in either English or SI units.

11. Symbols and Abbreviations - Define symbols and abbreviations the first time they are used
or make a list of "Symbols and Abbreviations." Adhere to standard symbols and
abbreviations.

12. Abstracts - An abstract of 200 words or less must be included in the paper. It is to be located
on the first page of the paper, immediately below author name(s). It should be prefaced by
the heading ABSTRACT (a first order heading) and followed by the INTRODUCTION to
the paper. At the end of the abstract, at least four KEYWORDS should be appended
following this format: (KEYWORDS: hydrologic modeling, climate change, water
management, runoff forecasting)
13. All papers will have the following author block typed at the bottom of the first page:
_______________________________________
Paper presented Western Snow Conference 2025
Below this citation will be the author’s names, preceded by 1, 2, 3, etc, as a superscript and
corresponding with the numbers in the title. Authors should include affiliation and address,
and email if they wish.
#### PLEASE DO NOT EMBED THE AUTHOR BLOCK IN A FOOTNOTE ####

14. Preprints - Authors may bring 10-20 copies of their paper to the meeting if they wish.

15. Material submitted for publication will not be returned.

16. If the above policy is not strictly adhered to, the editor may revise the paper without author
review, return the paper for revisions to follow the format, or decide not to publish the paper.

17. Informal Papers -

 A. Informal articles in the nature of narratives, amusing anecdotes, short stories, poems,
photos, or cartoons will be considered for publication in a section of the Proceedings
entitled, "Snow Notes." These papers are particularly solicited from persons engaged
in the collection and recording of field data or making runoff forecasts.

 B. At the discretion of the Editor, informal articles may be selected for publication in the
"Snow Notes" section of the Proceedings. In special circumstances, the Program
Committee may also invite authors to present their articles in a non-technical portion of
the program.

 C. The length of each informal article shall not exceed five single-spaced, typewritten
pages or the equivalent in pictures, tables, etc.

 D. Informal articles must be submitted to the Editor by the end of the Annual Meeting in
order to be considered for publication. Manuscripts submitted for publication will not
be returned unless specifically requested, in writing, by the author. Again, under
extenuating circumstances (e.g., your Snow Cat got buried and all the notes and photos
you planned to include are in the cab), June 1 is the drop-dead date for submission.
